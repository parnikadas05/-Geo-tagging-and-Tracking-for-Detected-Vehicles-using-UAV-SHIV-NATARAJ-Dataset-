Geo-tagging and Tracking for Detected Vehicles using UAV (SHIV-NATARAJ Dataset)
 Overview

This project was developed in Google Colab to detect, track, and geo-register vehicles from UAV (drone) footage.
It combines YOLOv11n-OBB for detection, ByteTrack for tracking, and homography transformation for pixel ‚Üí GPS mapping. The outputs are exported as KML files for Google Earth visualization.

 Key Features

Run entirely in Google Colab (no local setup required).

Object detection with YOLOv11n-OBB.

Multi-object tracking using ByteTrack.

Geo-tagging using homography transformation.

Visualization of results on Google Earth.

How to Run (Colab)

Open the notebook in Google Colab:


Upload the UAV dataset (video).

Run the cells to:

Detect & track vehicles.

Apply geo-tagging using homography.

Export results as .mp4 (processed video) and .kml (Google Earth overlay).
